         <h2>How I Moved to Europe</h2>
         <p>Back in 2018, I was deciding if I should separate from active duty Air Force because I was stuck in San
            Antonio, Texas for five of the six years I enlisted...and there was no new assignment for me in sight.
            However, on July, 16 (my birthday?!?) I was blessed with the opportunity of a new assignment to be stationed
            in Ramstein, Germany.
            I arrived in February 2019 and started booking trips IMMEDIATELY! I was ready to see Europe! I've been able
            to go all over Germany, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and so many more countries. But here are a few of
            my most memorable and favorites!

            <h2>Madrid, Spain</h2>
            <p>
               Madrid is one of the most beautiful major cities I've ever visited. The city is rich in culture,
               historical monuments, musuems, galleries, and the food! I visited some delicious cafes and restaurants
               with the best sangria I've ever had. If you ever get a chance to go, don't forget to visit a Flamenco
               show!

            <h2>Amsterdam, Netherlands</h2>
            <p>
               If I could chose to live anywhere in Europe, it would be Amsterdam! Honestly, I love the entire country,
               but I fell in love with the city. The canals are an amazing cite to see, the culture, the history, the
               Heineken, the shopping...the list goes on and on!!! Just make sure you pay attention for bikes! I wasn't
               and almost got ran over (LOL!)

            <a name="prague"></a>
            <h2>Prague, Czech Republic</h2>
            <p>
               Prague is absolutely beautiful and I never thought I would be able to go to a city like this. It has a
               fairytale essence with a vibrant culture and some of the nicest and welcoming people I've ever
               encoutered. They're so proud of their country and can tell you so many amazing things about the city. The
               hospitality was A1!! The nightlife was great as well with Prague having amazing beer and pubs where you
               can enjoy Europe's best beers.

            <h2>Budapest, Hungary</h2>
            <p>
               Budapest is a stunning city! The views of the Buda castle across the river as stunning and cannot be
               described with words or even pictures...you need to go! I was also able to go to the most famous spa in
               Budapest, Széchenyi Thermal Bath, which is a the largest medicinal bath in Europe. Its water is supplied
               by two thermal springs, relaxation at its finest!

            <h2>Nice, France</h2>
            <p>
               Pronunciation: "Neess" I had no clue this place even existed until I moved to Europe, but Nice does not
               disappoint! As you can see, the views are breathtaking, the water is crystal blue and the seafood was so
               fresh! There was only one thing I'd tell anyone to be aware of, and that's the beaches are not sand
               beaches...they have rocks! Smooth stones line the beaches, so do what I did...book a private beach club
               and lay out on comfy furniture and enjoy!
            </p>

            <h2>Zürich, Switzerland</h2>
            <p>
               Switzerland is everything people say it is, clean, beautiful, expensive, full of culture and the best
               chocolate! This was the first time I ever swam in a lake...and what a lake it was! Absolutely clear
               waters...I could see my feet! In a lake! I wish I could afford to live here!

            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
               I found my retirement home in Mallorca. I love being by the beach...the sand was white and the waters
               crystal blue. I ate the best paella I've ever had, laid on the beach for hours and had an amazing time.
